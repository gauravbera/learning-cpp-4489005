// Learning C++ 
// Exercise 03_05
// Using Several Source Files, by Eduardo CorpeÃ±o 

// compiler tool chain 
//converts source code into an executable file
// c++ source file fed to compiler
// compiler translates c++ into assembly language
// assembly code file fed to the assembler
// the assembler produces an object file
// object file almost executable. only contains pieces of code
// assembly code written by us ? when we need to write a peripheral driver
// assembly file to assembler gives object file
// what about if we have only object files ?
// libraries are distributed as object files
// object files are co-related pieces of project
// linker stitches object files together to create executable binary file
// the executable binary file is what gets executed
// specifying all files to compile is easier with IDE
// if we need to work with compiler in command line, it can get complicated
// all information specified in a text file called as a makefile
// c++ files are header and impl file pairs
// headers have .h --> contains definitions and function declaration, macros
// impl has .cpp extension --> impl of all functions in the header file
// impl must include their own corresponding header files
// external code should only include header files
// all impl files must be compiled
